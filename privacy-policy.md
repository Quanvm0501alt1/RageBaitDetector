Privacy Policy for Rage Bait Detector Userscript

Last Updated: July 5, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Rage Bait Detector" userscript ("the Script") handles your data. By installing and using the Script, you agree to the terms outlined below.
1. External Platforms and Third-Party Policies

IMPORTANT: The Script operates within the browser environment while you are using third-party platforms. Therefore, you must also read and understand the Terms of Service and Privacy Policies of:

    Facebook (Meta Platforms, Inc.)

    X (formerly Twitter)

    GroqCloud (Groq, Inc.)

We are not responsible for the data practices of these external platforms or services. Your use of the Script does not override their respective policies.
2. Data Collection and Usage by Our Script

Our Script is designed with your privacy in mind. We want to be transparent about how we handle your data:

    No Sale or Advertising: We do not sell your data to any third parties, nor do we use it for advertising purposes.

    Internal Usage Only: Any data processed by our Script is primarily used for:

        Debugging Bugs and Exploits: To identify and fix issues within the Script, including security vulnerabilities.

        Security Purposes: To enhance the overall security and integrity of the Script.

        Webhook (Optional): The Script may include an optional webhook feature. If enabled by you, this feature is used solely to report instances of posts that are confidently identified as rage bait (e.g., based on high heuristic scores and/or AI confirmation). This data helps us to update and improve the Script's heuristic detection capabilities to catch more rage bait effectively. You will have control over whether this webhook is active.

3. Data Handling with GroqCloud AI

    Conditional AI Analysis: As outlined in our Terms of Service, if a post's heuristic score is equal to or greater than 5, the Script will send the post's text content to the GroqCloud AI API for further analysis.

    GroqCloud's Practices: Your data, when sent to GroqCloud, is used by their AI to perform the requested detection. We cannot definitively know if GroqCloud uses this data for their own AI model training or other purposes. We advise you to carefully review GroqCloud's Privacy Policy to understand their data handling practices.

    Exercise Caution: Given that we do not control GroqCloud's internal data usage, please be careful and do not rely too much on the assumption that your data will not be used for training or other purposes by GroqCloud.

4. Imperfection and User Responsibility

    Continuous Development: Our script is constantly being developed and improved, including the use of AI for debugging and bug finding. Therefore, it IS NOT PERFECT. Remember, our Script IS NOT PERFECT, and you should not rely too heavily on its output.

5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or if you believe there is information lacking or issues beyond our stated limits, please feel free to contact me directly on Discord. We will endeavor to check and respond as quickly as possible.

By continuing to use the Rage Bait Detector, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to this Privacy Policy.
